For the last few years my friends have been participating in an interesting massive cycling event in Switzerland, and I’ve always been reacting to it right after it has happened. This year I’ve finally managed to recall to this event beforehand and have (to an extent) prepared to it. So, let me introduce: Cyclotour du Leman.

This is a cycling event where several thousand people on road bikes cycle around Geneva lake. One can choose one of three available options: the full circle from Lausanne to Lausanne (176 km) and cycle from Evian in France to Lausanne clockwise or counterclockwise (ending up in 112 and 64 km, roughly). This year about 3000 people took part in this event. One could use road bike, e-bike, but I also so some regular flat-bars bikes and horizontal bikes (leg-powered ones as well as hand-powered). 

I’ve joined a group of my friends and their fellows: Katya, Stas, Maxime, Gabriel, Miranda, Bence. As this event has followed a period of inactivity (due to the trip to US), I have set up just 2 goals: minimal - to reach the finish line before the final call, and maximal - to reach it with average speed of 25 km/h. I’ve never participated in such events, so I couldn’t anticipate how fast and long could I go. It’s quite different from bikepacking, and I also didn’t know my limits (due to under- and over-training in the previous days). 

Weather forecast has been ugly - it was supposed to rain, so I had to take a bit of rain covers. Also it was supposed to be cloudy - so I haven’t bothered with taking sunscreen. My bicycle’s brakes don’t perform well in the drizzle, so I was a bit concerned about it. Eventually we have not seen a single rain drop, and all skin that has been exposed has been sunburned.

We started around 7:10. The crowd at the start is huge! We kicked off, and Maxime started pacing our group. I was horrified looking at my headunit - we were going around 34-38 km/h. I didn’t know how much I could survive with this pace, although cycling behind somebody is much easier than cycling alone. 

Around 35 km our group has split: Katya and Stas got dropped. I first decided to stay with them, but later changed my mind. This was an expensive decision: catching up a group of someone even just 500 meters in front of you is a nightmare. I’ve pushed in clean air with speed of 40 km/h for several minutes, pushing my heart rate to 170-s. I’ve reached the next peloton that seemed to be fast enough (it was about 31 km/h), and sticked to it to have a break. I already started thinking that I’ve lost both pelotons of my friends, as suddenly a faster peloton (around 37 km/h) overtook ours. I joined these guys, and my chase has continued. After about 10 km I finally reached peloton of my friends, and sticked to it almost to the end. 

First stop has happened at Evian, 64km). We have stopped for a while, and as it appeared later - Katya and Stas did not. I was at this point fine with not stopping, but we stopped anyway. It took us a while, probably about 10 minutes. After that we continued.

I’ve managed to keep up with guys until the third stop. There they took a quick break and went further. I’ve told them that I can’t keep this pace up anymore (they were going 37 km/h at this point). Also it was a harder part, Geneva-Lausanne, it’s where most of ascent of the route is. From Geneva Maxime was going hard, it was a downhill first, and then he has caught a rush. I’ve been trying desperately to keep up his pace, but after 5-10 km dropped behind significantly, he’s from a completely different league.

For the last part of the route (about 40km) I’ve started alone, quickly joined a solo-cyclist that was going at convenient pace and then joined a peloton of some swiss team that was keeping 31km/h. Every 5 km I was thinking like “okay, after 3 km I stop for another break, I stop for another break”, but eventually I’ve managed to keep up with them until Morges, about 15 km to the finish line. There they slowed down to catch up with the members that dropped behind, and I went on my own.

I still managed to keep roughly 31 km/h on the straights, and I clearly remember an excitement of seeing the Rolex building of EPFL. EPFL is very close to Lausanne, so I knew it was basically a straight finish line until the end. And so I pushed to the end without stops, and was extremely happy to cross the finish line.

My dirty time has been 6h 10min, moving time - 5h 25 min. Comparing to marathon, it’s been much easier. Yes, it’s longer, but I kept heart rate of 140..150 bpm all the time, at marathon it was 4 hours of 170+ bpm. Some muscles seemed to start cramping, but eventually I had a slight cramp only when I was getting off the bike after crossing the finish line. Katya and Stas have been the fastest of us, as they skipped the stop at Evian. I think their dirty time was round 5:50. 

It was my first event where I’ve been riding with so many cyclists. It’s not a race, and the organizers insist on not calling it a race, so there is not ranking in the result. But I find it a great way to try racing-style cycling for amateurs like me. I loved the event, I might later take part in other cycling events (although I’m not sure about this one, for the second time it might be a bit boring).
