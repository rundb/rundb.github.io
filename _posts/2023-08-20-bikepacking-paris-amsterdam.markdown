Every year since 2020 me and 2 of my friends (Katya and Stas) go for a multi-day bikepacking trip. It started in July 2020 with Via Rhone (Lyon-Montpellier), continued with Lausanne-Genoa, Munich-Venice. This year we basically ran out of classic routes that would've been more challenging. I was long time thinking of bikepacking with a tent, but guys have been sceptical about it. But this year they have offered it themselves, and also we decided to go for a 1000-km (one megameter :D) tour. We ended up with a route Paris-Amsterdam, following part of [La Seine a Velo](https://www.laseineavelo.com/) and [Eurovelo 4](https://en.eurovelo.com/ev4).
