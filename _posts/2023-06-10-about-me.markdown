Hi there! I'm Roman, owner and developer of Github profile [rundb](https://github.com/rundb). 

![This is me]( assets/images/profile.jpg ) 

I've been working as a C/C++ software engineer in the domain of embedded software development since 2016. Most of my career so far I've been working on automotive software,
but also touched a bit of wearable electronics, a bit of PCB-design, a bit of FPGA development.

Outside of work I have a very active lifestyle. My passion is skydiving: I've got more than 500 jumps, focusing now on freefly and canopy piloting. I also do cycling (mostly
bikepacking, I'm not into competitive cycling), learn languages (speak English, Russian and German, aiming at Spanish), ski, snowboard, surf, 3D-printing and design of CNC machines,
video-editing, photography, and many other things except for swimming - I hate swimming.

I love modern technologies. I've got bachelor's and master's degree in applied physics and mathematics, specializing in computer networks, distributed control systems and radiolocation.

**P.S.** R and B stand for `red`-und-`black`. These are the colors of all my sports equipment between ages of 25 and 28. It's changed, but the name stayed.
